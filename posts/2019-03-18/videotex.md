# Videotex 

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotex): 

```
Videotex (or "interactive videotex") was one of the earliest implementations of an end-user information system
```

Videotex is interesting to me, not just because of its aesthetic qualities, but because it attempted to adapt existing systems -- the broadcast TV and telephone systems -- to new, interactive uses. 

Several systems of interest are:

- [Minitel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minitel) in France, by far the most popular and widely adopted system. It was unique in that it was somewhat decentralized.
- [Prestel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prestel) in the UK, which was operated by the General Post Office
- [Viewtron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewtron) in the US, which was operated by AT&T and Knight-Ridder publishing. It was a dismal failure, but produced an aesthetic af video:

The Viewtron interface, in particular, is intriguing to me. It used a language called [NAPLPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPLPS), an extremely low-bandwidth graphics language that could produce complex graphics using terse object commands. I would love to get my hands on an implementation of this language and do something with it.
