# Videotex 

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotex): 

```
Videotex (or "interactive videotex") was one of the earliest implementations of an end-user information system
```

Videotex is interesting to me, not just because of its aesthetic qualities, but because it attempted to adapt existing systems -- the broadcast TV and telephone systems -- to new, interactive uses. 

Several systems of interest are:

- [Minitel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minitel) in France, by far the most popular and widely adopted system. It was unique in that it was somewhat decentralized.
- [Prestel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prestel) in the UK, which was operated by the General Post Office
- [Viewtron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewtron) in the US, which was operated by AT&T and Knight-Ridder publishing. It was a dismal failure, but produced an aesthetic af video:

The Viewtron interface, in particular, is intriguing to me. It used a language called [NAPLPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPLPS), an extremely low-bandwidth graphics language that could produce complex graphics using terse object commands. I would love to get my hands on an implementation of this language and do something with it. 

Another interesting avenue of research is the Singapore Teleview system, which transmitted imagery via "Full Field Teletext transmissions from dedicated data inserters/UHF TV Transmitters." My understanding is this means imagery was transmitted the same way TV signals were transmitted! I'd love to reimplement this.
