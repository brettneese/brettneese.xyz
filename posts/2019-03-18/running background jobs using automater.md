# Running Background Shell Scripts Using Automater

As part of some recent housekeeping, I recently swapped the backend of this blog (powered by the wonderful Blot.io) from Dropbox to Git -- the reason being that I wanted an easy way to share drafts with friends if necessary. Unfortunately there's not a good a good Google Docs for Markdown files in Dropbox, but everyone knows how to use GitHub[^1].

That being said, I didn't want to fuss with issuing Git commands every time I update a post. I really like the Dropbox UX - I just save, and the post is live. If I ever want to fix a typo in any post, I just fix it in my local editor and save. It's a workflow I love. The distance between thought and publish is as minimal as possible. 

[^1] Several of my friends have asked me to use Google Docs for sharing drafts. I don't like this because it's so widely different from my usual Markdown workflows.
