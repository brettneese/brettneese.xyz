# Running Background Shell Scripts Using Automater

As part of some recent housekeeping, I recently swapped the backend of this blog (powered by the wonderful Blot.io) from Dropbox to Git -- the reason being that I wanted an easy way to share drafts with friends if necessary. Unfortunately there's not a good a good Google Docs for Markdown files in Dropbox, but everyone knows how to use GitHub[^1].

That being said, I didn't want to fuss with issuing Git commands every time I update a post. I really like the Dropbox UX - I just save, and the post is live. If I ever want to fix a typo in any post, I just fix it in my local editor and save. It's a workflow I love. The distance between thought and publish is as minimal as possible, as I believe it should be (I can mark posts as drafts before they get published.)

So I found and installed `git-watch`, a script that monitors my blog directory and automatically commits and pushes to both by Blot remote and my GitHub remote on every file save. But I wanted this to run always, just like Dropbox did. 

Thankfully, it's easy to wrap shell scripts into Automater actions. And when you do so, you even get this little UI in your menu bar 

[^1] Several of my friends have asked me to use Google Docs for sharing drafts. I don't like this because it's so widely different from my usual Markdown workflows.
