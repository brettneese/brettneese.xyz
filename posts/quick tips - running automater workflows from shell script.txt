# Invoke Automator Workflows From Terminal/Shell on OSX



Working on more automation around this blog, I learned last night that it's possible to run Automater workflows from the shell:

```
/usr/bin/automator ~/Desktop/workflow.workflow
```

This can also be used within a shell script! Which could be added to [`launchd`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launchd)... 

Thanks to [`kcrypted` for the tip](https://krypted.com/mac-os-x/invoking-automator-workflows-command-line/)!
