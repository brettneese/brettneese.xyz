# Running Commands In the Root of a Git Directory 



I work in monorepos a lot, and often finding myself needing to run commands at the root of the repoistory from inside a package folder inside the repository. From the root, I use [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) for this, but from within the subdirectory, I just learned I could do something like:

```bash
git config --global alias.exec '!exec '
```

Now I can run things like:

```bash
git exec npm run deploy
```

from within a subdirectory.
