4. What new areas of learning are you hoping to explore in your graduate study?

While cybernetics is a relatively older, albeit somewhat neglected, discipline, I see an opportunity to dramatically expand its footprint throughout my graduate career. In particular, I'm interested in _applied cybernetics_ -- the _aestheticization_ of cybernetic principles through both art and social action. Through art, I hope to use to use my graduate study to hone a practice of transforming cybernetic philosophy into a visceral experience through the creation of aesthetic representations of the theory. That doesn't mean I want to disregard theory: for instance, I'm particularly interested in exploring queer theory in relation to cybernetics. 

Beyond that, however, I also aim to participate in social action through forming some kind of a social good organization dedicated to applying cybernetics towards humanist projects. I hope to leverage my position as an expat in Mexico City in a manner that allows me to connect fellow technologists to social justice issues that intersect with cybernetic theories; in particular, immigration and citizenship -- modern communication technologies are redefining the very grounds on which the nation-state is built, and I believe this tenuous relationship is at the core of our present-day political reality  -- not only to do a I want to explore this tension, but I want transform theory into collective action.
