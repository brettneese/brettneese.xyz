3. What experience do you bring to this area of study? (Please describe your background in relation to the area you are proposing to study.)

Over the past 8 years of part-time undergraduate study, I have focused on building a base on which to develop a deeper investigation into the field of cybernetics, on both a theoretical and an applied level.

My course choices (and major selection) were motivated by a desire to develop a basic cross-disciplinary theoretical background and approach to this subject: I studied Karl Marx, Michel Foucault, and Donna Haraway at DePaul; but I also studied economics and communication at Hong Kong Baptist University; social entrepreneurship during Semester at Sea in Europe; and technology and social change at Iowa State University. In doing so, I gain the basic theoretical structures I hope to expand upon in my graduate study. 

In the meantime, however, I was also building out a career as a practicing technologist -- not only learning how to code, but also learning how to build a business or social enterprise. My main source of income is now through supporting an application I helped build that helps engineers build out physical networks of power, fiber, and other infrastructure. I'm in charge of building systems that detect downtime and auto-remediate any issues with the underlying systems. This intense experience as a practicing technologist and social entrepreneur gives me the tools to apply theoretical engagement with applied practice: both through building aesthetic artistic representations of the theory and through building social structures that provide alternative, perhaps more humanist, ways to engage with machines, technological development, and each other.
