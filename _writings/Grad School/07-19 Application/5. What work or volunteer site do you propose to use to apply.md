5. What work or volunteer site do you propose to use to apply learning from the Program while you are enrolled?

During my graduate study, I'm intending to continue to develop my consulting practice, and use it as the basis for expanding my work into more projects in which cybernetics is directly relevant -- already, however, my work focuses on building digital systems which self-organize and self-heal, and just doing more of the same would be an excellent complement to my graduate study. That being said, there is also an expanding need in the media space for practitioners to create multisensory digital experiences, and driving my practice deeper into that space would allow me to engage with the theory in a truly practiced way. For instance, the Knight Foundation recently released a call for proposals looking for projects that apply immersive technology to the arts.

In addition, I want to form my own collective action organization that leverages my position as a global citizen to connect fellow technologists with issues that intersect with cybernetics -- in particular, immigration and citizenship, as digital technologies are transforming our relationship to each other and the nation-state, an issue at the core of our current political chaos. This means that although I already have quite a bit experience in this sector -- including serving as a partnerships director for a 501(c)3 with operations across the US, my graduate study will necessarily also include research in nonprofit management and entrepreneurship, which will become immediately applied as I found this organization.
