2. What particular area of study would you like to build into a MAAPS Focus Area? (Please briefly explain what the area is.)

I'm interested in studying what I'm calling "Applied Global Cybernetics." In the subtitle of his groundbreaking book on the field, Norbert Wiener defined "cybernetics" as the "control or communication in the animal and the machine." In other words, I'm interested in studying how machines regulate humans and how humans regulate machines. The study of human/machine/nature interaction isn't confined to one discrete academic field of study: Foucault plays as much a role here as does Deleuze and Guattari as do electrical engineers such as Norbert Wiener and communication scholars such as Marshall McLuhan. 

While I do have a soft spot for critical theory and hope to embark on a great deal of it in my graduate career, in particular, I am most interested in the application of my studies, particularly in a global/international context. Thus, the focus of my masters will incorporate critical theory, aesthetic practice, and the practice of building structures that provide an alternative paradigm through which we can interact with machine, and thus, each other.
