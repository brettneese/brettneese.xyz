Dear Mexico City Metro,

Let’s face it. You’re a mess. 

You’re hot. Sweaty. You need separate compartments for males and females and yet most women still feel unsafe on your trains. You never predict when you’re gonna arrive, and you often stop mid-route. You’re full of pickpockets, solicitors, and gamblers. You smell. Your subway stops smell. 

But within your sweaty compartments and in the transfer stations and in your maps lies the spirit of Mexico City: the dream of a giant community with room for everyone is alive and well. When the authorities raised your rates from 5 pesos (US$0.26) to 7 pesos (US$0.38), panic flooded the streets. After all, what good is a city if it’s not available to everyone? In fact, in contrast to most systems, the areas you don’t serve terribly well are the wealthy _colonias._   

You were designed for the poor and the unfortunate: your stops use icons, not names, to make them accessible to those who can’t read. Merchants and vagrants crowd the stations, hoping to make just enough to provide for their family. 

Global capitalism’s grip on your society is not your fault. You’re just there, like everyone else, trying to get by: and trying to help everyone else get by, too. You eek through from the hills to the historic center, assisting thousands if not hundreds of thousands of citizens on their 3-4 hour commute into the city every day just to help make a better life for their families. 

You’re humble, you’re sprawling, you’re dangerous, you’re communitarian. You’re everything that makes Mexico City great. 

And your rubber tires instead of traditional steel rails make everyone’s rides much faster and smoother than any other metro I’ve used. 

Never change,

Brett
